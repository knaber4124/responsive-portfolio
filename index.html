                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have been in sales for 17 years, have been successful but have also wanted a more chalenging and meaningful career. 
                    For the past 6 years I have been working at Comcast Business and have had the opportunity to grow in my role and am often given the opportunity to train new hires and tenured reps on both systems and policy matters. 
                    Even with all of this I am looking for a more rewarding career and a new challenge.</p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In college I took a course on basic website design, which did not get much beyond simple HTML and CSS coding but I enjoyed in very much. 
                    Recently I began to seriously consider a career change and found the coding bootcamp at UNH. 
                    After doing some research into developer careers, I began to reflect on that basic coding course. 
                    Between the fact that I enjoyed that class, the potential to be found in this field, and discussions I had with friends and neighbors and their experiences in the field, I decided to enroll in the coding bootcamp.</p>
                <br>
                <!---Add a section about Bootcamp experience throughout the course and especially at the end--->
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The true impetus for this change is so that I can provide a better life for my family. 
                    My wife and I were married in 2010 and have 2 children, Evan and Jocelyn. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball with my family and reading about history, typically focusing on the Armenian Genocide and American history around the turn of the 20th century. </p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This page is intended to show some of the work that I have done in the bootcamp. I hope that you enjoy. Please feel free to send feeback in the Contact portion of this website.</p>
